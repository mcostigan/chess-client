# ChessClient

This project is a front-end UI for a chess application. It allows users to create/join games and play chess against real people. The code allows for registration and authentication and communicates moves in real-time using web sockets.

## Running the application
Before running the front-end, make sure that the server is running: [chess-server](https://github.com/mcostigan/chess-server/blob/main/README.md)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
